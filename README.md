# GridView Example

GridView, just like RecyclverView, needs an adapter.  
The adapter needs to implement ListAdapter interface  
(this one)[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListAdapter.html]
(not this one)[https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/ListAdapter]

There is also ArrayAdapter that implement ListAdapter but it only support TextView as the View (bruh)
So BaseAdapter is the next best thing
